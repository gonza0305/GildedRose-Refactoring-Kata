    Simplifying if conditions In the original code, many if conditions were nested to check different cases. This 
    approach, in addition to making the code difficult to read, can cause errors. Therefore, I have reorganized the 
    conditions to make them simpler and easier to understand.
    
    Extracting logic to functions A good programming practice is to break the code into small functions that perform 
    specific tasks. In this case, I have extracted the quality update logic from the different item types to separate 
    functions, which makes the code easier to read and understand.
    
    Using ternary operators Ternary operators are a concise way to express conditions in a single line of code. In 
    the original code, several levels of nesting were used to check conditions and update values. By using ternary 
    operators, the code is more readable and easier to follow.
    
    Simplify quality update The quality update for different types of items had become a complex series of 
    conditions. I simplified this by using a list of dictionaries containing information about each item type and how 
    its quality should be updated.
    
    Removing unnecessary comments In the original code, there were many comments that did not provide valuable 
    information. I have removed these comments to reduce the amount of noise in the code and make it easier to read.
    
    Make use of variables for constant values In the original code, there were some constant values, 
    such as "Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros" and "Conjured", which were used several times in different parts of the 
    code. I created variables for these constant values to make the code easier to understand and maintain.
    
    Simplifying the code
    Finally, I removed all unnecessary code and made changes to the formatting of the code to make it more readable.
